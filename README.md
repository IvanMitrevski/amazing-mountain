# Responsive Landing Page Project

* Using only HTML and CSS
* I have created the design of the page using Figma. After that I began coding the mobile first design and by using media queries made the page responsive.
* I experimented with CSS grid layout and learned lots of stuff about what I can do with this layout and how it works.

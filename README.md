# Responsive Landing Page Project

* Using only HTML and CSS
* I have created the design of the page using Figma. After that I began coding the mobile first design and by using media queries made the page responsive.
* I experimented with CSS grid layout and I am going to be honest, I STRUGGLED A LOT. Nevertheless learned lots of stuff about what can I do with this layout and how it works.
